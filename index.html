        <h1>About Me!</h1>
        <p>
          Hello! I'm Rakshit, a passionate front-end developer with a creative edge and a unique background in professional dance. My journey from the dance floor to the tech world has imbued me with a distinct perspective on design and a keen eye for detail. With a strong foundation in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and React, I create responsive and visually appealing web applications. My proficiency extends to using SASS for efficient styling and Git & GitHub for version control. I am also experienced in building and customizing websites on platforms like WordPress and Shopify.
          <br />
          I believe in the power of honesty and creativity, both of which are integral to my approach to development. My transition from a professional dancer to an IT professional has taught me the importance of discipline, dedication, and continuous learning—traits that I bring to every project I undertake. In my work, I strive to blend technical expertise with artistic vision, creating web experiences that are not only functional but also aesthetically engaging.
          </br>
          Whether it's crafting a seamless user interface or debugging complex code, I am committed to delivering high-quality results that exceed expectations. When I'm not coding, you can find me dancing, exploring new design trends, or contributing to the developer community. I'm always excited to connect with like-minded professionals and collaborate on innovative projects.
